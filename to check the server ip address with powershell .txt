
BUSINESS RULES: The data gateway is a single point of access to onpremise datasets by Azure Data factory services within Council’s Azure Tenancies. This infrastructure polls and serves data requests initiated within Council’s Azure Tenancies. This piece of infrastructure has frequent and regular patches and is evolving quickly. This standard change is required to streamline the compliance with Council’s change processes and reduce the volatility of this adhoc patching process. This change will be restricted for use to onpremise data gateways. This standard change can be performed in the non-production environments outside business hours after 5 PM AEST. This standard change can be performed for production environments outside business hours provided service is not disrupted as part of the patching and rollback process. If the scope of this standard change is production and coincides with a maintenance weekend then it must have written approval from ICT_Release_Management to proceed. This change is not to be used to patch Council’s onpremise data gateway infrastructure. This standard change is not to be used if there is no documented application/patching rollback process available. ARTEFACT(S) TO BE INCLUDED {eg. Detailed Design Document} Approval from Data TSM Approval from Compute TSM Evidence of communication to the stakeholders and acknowledgement/approval of the work in production. Acknowledgement of the outages in non-production by stakeholders. For production changes relevant SLM approval is required. For production changes the successful non-production changes are related. For production changes on maintenance weekends written approval from ICT_Release_Management. SECTION: Business Driver and Scheduling Implications Please ensure all questions are answered: • Answers of ‘NONE’, ‘NIL, ‘No Impact’ or ‘N/A’ maybe valid but must be qualified with an explanation • Council means Brisbane City Council, Division, Branch, Section, Staff, Users and/or Internal/External Customers • Impact means regulatory/compliance obligations, reputation, financial, business expectations etc. WHAT ARE THE BUSINESS REASONS FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS CHANGE? Vendors release patches on a regular basis for the Microsoft operating system and Self-Hosted Integration Runtime Infrastructure. These patches include fixes for defects as well as security patches. The purpose of this change is to deploy these patches to Self-Hosted Integration Runtime Infrastructure. APPLICATION: SELF HOSTED INTEGRATION RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT: DEV These patches are required to be applied to ensure Council maintains compliance with Council's ICT Security Standards. Outside this maintenance schedule the risk of an unscheduled service outage for the council businesses supported by this infrastructure increases. EXPLAIN THE IMPACT TO COUNCIL IF THE CHANGE FAILS? In Production. No impact. Scope of changes will not affect availability of services. Rollback of installation will not disrupt service. In Non-Production. Service disruption will be experienced with the patching process. Rollback of installation will disrupt service. The nominated environments will suffer a complete outage and will not be available to support Council ICT project and BAU workloads. The rollback will leverage patching rollback scripts and snapshots taken prior to commencing patching. IF THIS CHANGE IS RESCHEDULED/DEFERRED OR NOT APPROVED, HOW WILL COUNCIL BE IMPACTED? If this change has been raised in response to an incident, then the incident will not be resolved in a timely manner. If this change has been raised in response to a project requirement then the project deadlines may not be met. SECTION: Change Installation Impacts Please ensure all questions are answered: • System means the technology and/or application • Service means the business service or function that is being provided/supported by the technology or application • Answers of ‘NONE’, ‘NIL, ‘No Impact’ or ‘N/A’ maybe valid but must be qualified with an explanation • Council means Brisbane City Council, Division, Branch, Section, Staff, Users and/or Internal/External Customers WHICH SYSTEMS WILL BE AFFECTED DURING THE INSTALL System Impacted: SHIR – DEV Timings of Impact: 12/12/2024 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM Impact: No Disruption Impact Summary: There will be no noticeable impact to customers of this application. WHICH BUSINESS SERVICES/FUNCTIONS WILL BE AFFECTED DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THIS CHANGE AND HOW WILL THEY BE AFFECTED? Service Impacted: No business service will be impacted. Timings of Impact: 12/12/2024 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM Impact: No Disruption Impact Summary: There will be no noticeable impact to consumers of SHIR – DEV SECTION: Risk Management WHAT ARE THE KEY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THIS CHANGE? HOW HAVE THEY BEEN MITIGATED? Risk during installation: The installation exhausts resources on the nominated infrastructure (See technical section). Likelihood: Unlikely Consequence: Services supporting businesses may be degraded. Mitigation: The implementer will execute the installation on outside business hours. The patching approach adopted is a server at a time ensuring service remains undisrupted in production environments. The surviving server will be monitored to ensure resource utilisation on surviving server is below thresholds. WHAT ARE THE KEY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHANGE POST INSTALLATION? HOW HAVE THEY BEEN MITIGATED? Risk post installation: The installation is not fit for purpose. Likelihood: Unlikely Consequence: Desired service is not delivered resulting in rework. Mitigation: A rollback position will be constructed as part of this activity. Rollback will be performed at the application level. Where application rollback is not available then an infrastructure rollback will be created. SECTION: Testing Infrastructure Testing: WHAT TESTING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED? Security / Penetration: Not Required Configuration: Not Required Performance / Load: Not Required Application Testing: WHAT TESTING OF THE APPLICATION and/or INTEGRATIONS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED? Integration: For non-production change this is the purpose of this change User Acceptance: Not Required Installation: For non-production change this is the purpose of this change Backout: For non-production change this will be within the scope of this change Security / Penetration: Not Required Performance / Load: Not Required == TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION == TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGE/RELEASE DEPLOYMENT: The purpose of this change is to patch the Self Hosted Integration Runtime infrastructure hosted in Council’s private cloud. This infrastructure provides access to On-Premise datasets to Azure Data Factory implemented within council’s Azure tenancies. The scope of this activity is to be performed on the following environment: SERVERS: M853DEV1, M853DEV2 OS PATCHES TO BE INSTALLED: LATEST OS PATCH APPLICATION PATCHES TO BE INSTALLED: SHIR - DEV ENVIRONMENT: NON-PRODUCTION INSTALLATION PLAN (High Level Steps) 1. Data Team raise and schedule standard change obtaining approvals from the designated authorised people. The following steps will be performed to one server in the list at a time sequentially: 2. Data Team to confirm operation of services in the server list prior to commencement of this activity. 3. Wintel Team to confirm operation of servers in the server list taking note of errors in system logs. 4. Data Team stop data gateway services on the nominated server. 5. Wintel Team take a snapshot of the server and apply the latest available OS patches and confirm successful restart. 6. Wintel perform health check of server and then handover to data team. 7.
