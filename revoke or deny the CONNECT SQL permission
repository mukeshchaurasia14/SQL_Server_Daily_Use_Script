You’re getting Error 33129 because the login "AD\Group_Name" is a Windows group login, and SQL Server does not allow ALTER LOGIN ... DISABLE for Windows groups.

The fix is to revoke or deny the CONNECT SQL permission instead of disabling the login.

Why This Happens
ALTER LOGIN ... DISABLE works only for:

SQL logins

Individual Windows user logins

For Windows group logins, SQL Server expects you to control access via:

CONNECT SQL permission at the server level

Or removal of the login entirely

Resolution Options

Option 1 – Revoke CONNECT SQL
This removes the ability for the Windows group to connect, without deleting it.


USE master;
GO
REVOKE CONNECT SQL FROM [AD_GROUP_OR_USER_NAME];


Option 2 – Deny CONNECT SQL
This explicitly denies connection to the SQL instance for that Windows group (overrides grants).


USE master;
GO
DENY CONNECT SQL TO  [AD_GROUP_OR_USER_NAME];


Option 3 – Remove the Login Completely
If you don’t need this Windows group in SQL Server at all:

USE master;
GO
DROP LOGIN  [AD_GROUP_OR_USER_NAME];

NOTE:  ⚠ This will break access for all members of that AD group if they are not explicitly granted access via other logins.
